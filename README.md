# LittleLink

This is my fork of [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink), but with my links - fork the original if you want to have your own ;-)


## Getting Started with LittleLink

This page has been built with every pre-designed button available in LittleLink by default. You can rearrange and delete as needed.

You can add your own brand or others brands you may need in the `css/brands.css` file. 

You can add custom icons to `images/icons/...`. It is recommended to use a 24x24 .SVG.

Edit the "Your Image Here" section to add your own personal branding, like a picture of yourself or your brand logo!

Edit the "Title" section to change the page heading. You can use something like your name, your social handle, or your brand name.

Edit the "Short Bio" section tell users about yourself or your brand.
